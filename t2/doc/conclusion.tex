\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

To conclude, in this laboratory assigment the aim of analysing the circuit has been achieved. The values of the currents and voltages have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. The results match precisely, as expected, since this is a straightforward circuit containing only linear components, therefore the theoretical and simulation models shouldn't differ.

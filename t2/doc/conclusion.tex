\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

To conclude, in this laboratory assigment the objective of analysing a circuit containing a sinusoidal voltage source and a capacitor has been achieved. 
Static, time and frequency analyses have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. 
The results match considerably, as expected, since this is a relatively straightforward circuit containing only one capacitor apart from linear components, therefore the theoretical and simulation models shouldn't differ.

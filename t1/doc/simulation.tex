\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis and the distribution of the numbers of the nodes was done from the top to bottom and from right to left. It is important to note that was necessary to implement a test voltage source (V3) providing 0V to analyze the current in node 4. This creation does not affect the dynamics of the circuit, therefore, neither does it change the results.

Compared to the theoretical analysis the simulation showed practically identical results, expect for small divergence in decimal places. It is worth mentioning that ngspice software also uses the same mathematical methods as octave to find results, hence, this result was already expected.
